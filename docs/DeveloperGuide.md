### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 3.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Skill` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Skill` object per unique skill, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Skill` objects. This can also be applied to the `Faculty` class (as shown in the diagram), `Major`, `Language`, `Framework` and `Tag` classes.
<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### 3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **4. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Optional and Multiple Data Fields Feature

#### 4.1.1 Implementation
The **optional and multiple data fields** feature allows the user to add labels to a particular contact under these specific categories: **skill, programming language, programming framework, tag,** and **remark**.

This implementation uses the following classes in the `Model` component:
* `Skill` in the skill package
* `Language` in the skill package
* `Framework` in the skill package
* `Tag` in the tag package
* `Remark` in the remark package

Furthermore, this implementation introduces the following classes in the `Logic` component: 
* `AppendCommand` that extends Command
* `AppendPersonDescriptor` that is nested in AppendCommand
* `AppendCommandParser` that implements Parser<AppendCommand>
* `RemoveCommand` that extends Command
* `RemovePersonDescriptor` that is nested in RemoveCommand
* `RemoveCommandParser` that implements Parser<RemoveCommand>

In addition, the following classes are utilised in the `Ui` component
* `PersonCard` that extends UiPart<Region>
* `PersonListCard.fxml` to display the labels

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `append` and `remove` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application with existing contacts from previous uses. 

Step 2. The user executes `append 3 l/python` to append "python" to the list of programming languages of the contact at index 3. The command passes through `LogicManager`, `AddressBookParser`, and `AppendCommandParser` which creates an `AppendPersonDescriptor` object and subsequently an `AppendCommand` object to be executed.

Step 3. After the `AppendCommand` is executed and the interaction with the `Model` component is complete and fed back to the `Ui` component, the item `python` is now seen under the 3rd contact's list of programming languages, with no change to the previous existing programming languages. Languages are then sorted alphanumerically in the display. 

Step 4. If the user realises that a mistake in assigning the wrong language, i.e. should have been "java" instead of "python", the user executes the `rm 3 l/INDEX`, where index is the index of the "python" language in the display of the 3rd contact. Similar to the `AppendCommand`, the `RemoveCommand` deletes only the targeted language specified by the index, with no change to the other existing data fields.   

The following sequence diagrams show how the `append` command works:

1. In this sequence diagram, the focus is on the `Logic` component and how an `AppendCommand` object is created once the user inputs `append 3 l/python`.
![AppendSequenceDiagram](images/AppendSequenceDiagram.png)

2. In this next sequence diagram, the focus is on the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` components when the `AppendCommand` is executed. 
![AppendSequenceDiagram2](images/AppendSequenceDiagram2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AppendCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `append` command:
![AppendActivityDiagram](images/AppendActivityDiagram.png)


#### 4.1.2 Design  considerations
The previous implementation of **AB3's** `edit` command deleted all `Tags` when editing. There was no way to add new data fields to existing ones without re-entering all data fields manually. Similarly, there was no way to remove a specific `Tag`. Therefore, for optional and multiple data fields such as **skills**, **programming languages**, etc, appending and specific removal were significant design improvements. 

One of the main considerations was to deal with the project constraints of not using a separate database. Therefore, the design implementation would have to be done over data structures stored in a JSON format. 

Another consideration regarding the display design was to display the data fields alphanumerically instead of when they were chornologically added. This facilitates the user's visual categorisation across multiple contacts. (i.e. "backend" would always appear before "frontend" for all contacts that are applicable).

Finally, defensive coding techniques were used by making a copy of the `AppendPersonDescriptor` class. 

#### 4.1.3 Alternatives
**Aspect: How the new data fields are implemented:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each `Person` object references their own data field objects. I.e. multiple `Language` objects named "python" may exist, with each object related to a specific `Person`.
* **Alternative 2 (future implementation):** An alternative implementation (arguably, more object oriented) would be to have a unique data field list for each **optional and mulitple data field**, i.e. skill, programming language, framework, tag, and remark, that `Person` references. This allows us to only require one data field object per unique element, instead of each `Person` needing their own data field objects. See [Model component alternative](#model-component) for more information. 

**Aspect: How the append command executes:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** HashSets are currently used for the appending of unique data field objects. The first HashSet is used to store the new data fields to append (provided by input). The second HashSet stores the existing data fields of the specified contact. The third HashSet is used to combine the first and second, and is then set to the target contact's data field HashSet. 
* **Alternative 2 (future implementation):** An alternative implementation, which uses one data field object per unique element (e.g.  [Model component alternative](#model-component)), would be to append new pointers to a list of existing pointers a `Person` has to various data field elements.

**Aspect: How the remove command executes:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Similar to the `append` command, the `rm` command also uses HashSets to store indexes and existing data fields. Additionally, the ArrayList data structure was used to implement Java generics for better code quality.
* **Alternative 2 (future implementation):** Similar to the `append` command, an alternative implementation would be to remove pointers in a list of existing pointers a `Person` has.

### 4.2 \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### 4.2.1 Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### 4.2.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### 4.3 Interactions feature

#### 4.3.1 Implementation
The interaction mechanism utilizes the same concept as other commands like `add` and `edit` with some tweaks.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the interaction mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs the command `interaction int/we just met on/2020-02-02`

Step 2. The command passes through the `LogicManager`. `LogicManager` creates a `AddressBookParser` which would help to parse and tokenize the command.

Step 3. `AddressBookParser` sees that it's a interaction command and creates a `InteractionCommandParser` object.

Step 4. `InteractionCommandParser` helps to extract out the tokens and generate a `InteractionCommand`. The input validation is mostly done at this stage.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Most input validation will be done at this stage.
</div>

The following sequence diagram visually describes the steps above:

![InteractionSequenceDiagram](images/InteractionSequenceDiagram.png)

  #### 4.3.2 Design considerations
  **Aspect: How interactions is stored:**
  
  * **Alternative 1 (current choice):** As a list of interactions in the Person object.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, intuitive design and navigatability
  * Cons: Heavy coupling with the person class
  
  * **Alternative 2:** As a list by itself, containing a reference to the Person it is attached to.
  * Pros: More isolated from the Person class, so less changes to overall code
  * Cons: Navigatability is reduced significantly

###  View feature

#### Implementation
The view mechanism utilizes the same concept as other commands 
like `add` and `edit`, but has a few distinct changes.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view mechanism
behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs the command `view 2`

Step 2. The command passes through the `LogicManager`. 
`LogicManager` creates a `AddressBookParser` which would help to 
parse and tokenize the command.

Step 3. `AddressBookParser` sees that it's a view command and creates a
`ViewCommandParser` object.

Step 4. `ViewCommandParser` helps to extract out the tokens and 
generate a `ViewCommand`.

Step 5. `ViewCommand` helps to call the updateViewedPerson method,
so that the GUI shows the correct Person.

The following sequence diagram visually describes the steps above:

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How viewedPerson is stored:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** As a FilteredList in the ModelManager.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, similar logic to filteredPersons, making it easy
    to understand. Easy to implement future versions in case there is a need
    to add functionality to view multiple contacts at once.
  * Cons: Not necessarily a good usage of a FilteredList since there should
    only be a single contact viewed at once for the current version.

* **Alternative 2:** As a single Person instance in the ModelManager.
  * Pros: More intuitive as there is only a single contact viewed at once currently.
  * Cons: More rigid and harder to improve upon for future versions.


###  Filter feature

#### Implementation
The filter mechanism utilizes the same concept as other commands like `find` with some tweaks.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs the command `filter f/computing`

Step 2. The command passes through the `LogicManager`. `LogicManager` creates a `AddressBookParser` which would help to parse and tokenize the command.

Step 3. `AddressBookParser` sees that it's a filter command and creates an `FilterCommandParser` object.

Step 4. `FilterCommandParser` helps to extract out the tokens and generate a `FilterCommand`. The input validation is mostly done at this stage.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Most input validation will be done at this stage.
</div>

The following sequence diagram visually describes the steps above:

![FilterCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FilterCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

###  Organisations feature

#### Implementation
The Organisation commands utilize the same concept as other commands like `add` and `delete` with some tweaks.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the organisation commands behave at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs the command `addorg n/Facebook e/hello@facebook.com`

Step 2. The command passes through the `LogicManager`. `LogicManager` creates a `AddressBookParser` which would help to parse and tokenize the command.

Step 3. `AddressBookParser` sees that it's an AddOrg command and creates a `AddOrgCommandParser` object.

Step 4. `AddOrgCommandParser` helps to extract out the tokens and generate a `AddOrgCommand`. The input validation is mostly done at this stage.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Most input validation will be done at this stage.
</div>

The following sequence diagram visually describes the steps above:

![OrganisationSequenceDiagram](images/OrganisationSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How persons in organisations are stored:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** As a list of persons in each organisation in the Address Book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, intuitive design
    * Cons: Any updates to a person in Address Book have to be checked and updated in each organisation

* **Alternative 2:** List of persons in each organisation stores the references to the persons
    * Pros: Any updates to a person in Address Book is synchronised with the organisations the person is in
    * Cons: Harder to implement
