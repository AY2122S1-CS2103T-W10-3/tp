ComputingConnection is for entrepreneurial students in NUS Computing who want to keep track of other students’ skill sets so that they can easily look for suitable people to work with on future projects. The users should prefer to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) over a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for efficiency with a keyboard.

Through an address book, this product aims to store information such as faculty, major, programming languages, interests, past projects, remarks of peers that the user has encountered throughout university. ComputingConnection will help the student remember and document his/her network of students encountered in NUS for easy reference in the future.
