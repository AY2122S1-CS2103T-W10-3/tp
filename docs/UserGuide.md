ComputingConnection is for computer science university students who prefer to use CLI over GUI, and want to keep track of the large amounts of friends and staff they have encountered in university.

Through an address book, this product aims to store information, such as faculty, course, frequency of meeting, phone numbers, etc, of friends or staff, so that the student will be able to remember and refer when needed.
